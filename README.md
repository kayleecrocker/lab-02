## Solution Explaination

**Adding City:** The user clicks ADD CITY and an EditText and Confim button appears at the bottom of the screen. When confirm is clicked, the city is added to the list (nothing will be added if the EditText is left empty).

**Deleting City:** The clicks DELETE CITY and a red message appears asking the user to click the city they wish to delete. The next city in the list to be clicked is removed.
